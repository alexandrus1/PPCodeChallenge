# Problem
Once upon a time, on a N*N grid, there was N*N cats, each cat sits on a square.

Cats like to jumps around, so each minute, each cat jumps to one of the neighbouring cell. 2 cells are considered neighbours if they share 1 edge. Note that the cells at the corners only have 2 neighbours, cells at the edges have 3 neighbours and the other cells have 4 neighbours.

After T minutes, what is the expected number of unoccupied squares?

# Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 30
- 1 <= T <= 50

# Input
- 1st line: N and T

# Output
- 1st line: result, rounded to 6 decimal places.
